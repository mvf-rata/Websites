			<h2 class="h2" id="Fly">The Flight</h2>
			<p>
				My journey took place in Semptember 2017.<br>After learning that Tokyo has two airports: Haneda and Narita, I decided I wanted to land in Haneda, since it is closer to Tokyo.<br>So I searched a long time for a flight so I could save some money. In the end i flew from Stuttgart to Paris and from Paris to Tokyo.<br>It took me 4 and a half hours to get to Paris. There I had 1 hour to get to my next terminal.<br> The flight to Tokyo took about 18 hours. At least I could choose between french and japanes cuisine on board, so the food wasn't as bad.<br> For the remaining time I watched a lot of movies and also slept a lot.<br>

			<h2 class="h2" id="First">First Day</h2>
			<p>
				The moment I stepped out of the plane I could tell that I was very excited.<br>I grabbed my luggage and went straight to the metro. There I was confronted with the first problem.<br>I didn't know how the ticket machine worked and for some reason it only was in japanese. The railway map didn't clarify anything either.<br>After I talked to some staff I figured it out where I need to go to get to my capsule hotel.<br>That's right, I slept 10 nights in a capsule hotel. Why? Because it is cheap and I wouldn't have had any use for a big hotel room.<br>Since I don't speak japanese I needed to get what I want in english or in sign language. Pointing at things works in every country. The problem with english is that the japanese don't speak english very well.
